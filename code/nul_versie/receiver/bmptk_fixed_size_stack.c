/* This file can define macros to choose variations of the IEEE float
   format:

   _FLT_LARGEST_EXPONENT_IS_NORMAL

	Defined if the float format uses the largest exponent for finite
	numbers rather than NaN and infinity representations.  Such a
	format cannot represent NaNs or infinities at all, but it's FLT_MAX
	is twice the IEEE value.

   _FLT_NO_DENORMALS

	Defined if the float format does not support IEEE denormals.  Every
	float with a zero exponent is taken to be a zero representation.
 
   ??? At the moment, there are no equivalent macros above for doubles and
   the macros are not fully supported by --enable-newlib-hw-fp.

   __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN

        Defined if the float format is big endian.  This is mutually exclusive
        with __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN.

   __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN
 
        Defined if the float format is little endian.  This is mutually exclusive
        with __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN.

   Note that one of __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN or __IEEE_LITTLE_ENDIAN must be specified for a
   platform or error will occur.

   __IEEE_BYTES_LITTLE_ENDIAN

        This flag is used in conjunction with __IEEE_BIG_ENDIAN to describe a situation 
	whereby multiple words of an IEEE floating point are in big endian order, but the
	words themselves are little endian with respect to the bytes.

   _DOUBLE_IS_32BITS 

        This is used on platforms that support double by using the 32-bit IEEE
        float type.

   _FLOAT_ARG

        This represents what type a float arg is passed as.  It is used when the type is
        not promoted to double.

/*  The traditional meaning of 'extern inline' for GCC is not
  to emit the function body unless the address is explicitly
  taken.  However this behaviour is changing to match the C99
  standard, which uses 'extern inline' to indicate that the
  function body *must* be emitted.  Likewise, a function declared
  without either 'extern' or 'static' defaults to extern linkage
  (C99 6.2.2p5), and the compiler may choose whether to use the
  inline version or call the extern linkage version (6.7.4p6).
  If we are using GCC, but do not have the new behaviour, we need
  to use extern inline; if we are using a new GCC with the
  C99-compatible behaviour, or a non-GCC compiler (which we will
  have to hope is C99, since there is no other way to achieve the
  effect of omitting the function if it isn't referenced) we use
  'static inline', which c99 defines to mean more-or-less the same
  as the Gnu C 'extern inline'.  */
